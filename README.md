## Thoughts
I quite enjoyed the process of making this project. A calculator seems a simple enough project on the surface, but it can be quite challenging for a beginner. While I knew how to "make" the calculator from a functional perspective, I had trouble with the "structure" of the project - i.e. which functions should do what and how to get them to interact with each other in a way that not only works, but that makes sense logically.
